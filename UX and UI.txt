What are UX and UI?
	User experience(UX)
		- User experiences are the experiences the users get by using a program, site or a game, when working with
		  UX the developer has to keep in mind to keep every function as simple as possible so that the users
		  don't get confused about how the program, site or how the game workes. and this is done my trying to make
		  most process as streamlined as possible.
		- There are some pros and cons of trying to make the user experience better and the pros are most often then not
		  that the user has a better time but letting the user have a better time takes time and effort from the programmer
		  and that will make the programming harder for the programmer.
	User interface(UI)
		- The user interface is the interaction between the user and the program itself, this is most often used for keyboards
		  for etc or for plethora of other things to control the computer.
What's the difference between UX and UI and how can they be used for interface development and programming?
