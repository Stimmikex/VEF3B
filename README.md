# Verkefni 4 - Rfid Reader

###### Verkefni 4
Verkefni 4 is a project where we're using a rfid reader and a raspberry pi to create a school log system, where every student
has there own rfid were they can sign into class and sign themselfs onto classrooms that are empty, we're also using a screen
with the project where the users will be able to see who's using each classroom at any given time.

###### Future plans
The future plans for this project are just to get it up running, to fixes some of the issue with it and to make the hardware
more compact.

# Work partition

###### Styrmir Óli Þorsteinsson
Worked on the hardware part of the project.
soldered the rfid reader, connected the rfid reader to the raspberry pi
and I did the same thing for the Arduino test that I was doing, and did the coding for the Arduino.

###### Bjarki Fannar Snorrason
Worked on the programing part of the project.
Programmed the raspberry pi to used the rfid reader, had some problems with the raspberry pi at first
the pi didn't want to update/install python that we uses to program the pi, fixed the issue and the code worked.

###### Overall
We had a bad start with the project where the first week and a half, the raspberry pi didn't want to update to python 2.7
and we spent most of that time troubleshooting the raspberry pi and the went trough the screen, power and the pi itself.
In the end we found out that the problem was the power not being enough for the operation the rfid reader and the raspberry pi,
we fixed it and then we spend the reminder of the time for the project, working on the code.

# Hardware
Rfid is used as a part of a hardware where the hardware/computer can read the rfid tag and give the computer the rfid code,
which then can be used as id for all kindof taskes, this is mostly used for credit cards, work security and many more functions that can
benifit from using a presonal id that can be set on a card, tag or your phone.
To use the rfid reader you'll need to have a cumputer to process the rfid code, we tryed arduino and raspberry pi to read the code,
but in the end we went with the raspberry pi as it has more functions and can be programed in more then one programing language.

###### Raspberry pi
The raspberry pi is a small computer that can be used. We decided to uses the raspberry pi over the arduino as it has more features 
that we can use, other programming languages and more power to handle the requests.

###### Arduino
Arduino is also a small computer that can be used with the rfid reader, the downsite of using the arduino is that it uses C and only C
as its main programing language.
