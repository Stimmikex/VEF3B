# Verkefni 4 - Rfid Reader

# Hardware
Rfid is used as a part of a hardware where the hardware/computer can read the rfid tag and give the computer the rfid code,
which then can be used as id for all kindof taskes, this is mostly used for credit cards, work security and many more functions that can
benifit from using a presonal id that can be set on a card, tag or your phone.
To use the rfid reader you'll need to have a cumputer to process the rfid code, we tryed arduino and raspberry pi to read the code,
but in the end we went with the raspberry pi as it has more functions and can be programed in more then one programing language.

###### Raspberry pi
The raspberry pi is a small computer that can be used.

###### Arduino
Arduino is also a small computer that can be used with the rfid reader, the downsite of using the arduino is that it uses C and only C
as its main programing language.
